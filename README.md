### 👨‍💻 Engineering Profile

I am a Senior AI Engineer & Cloud Architect focused on **AI-augmented DevOps** and **Resiliency Engineering**. My work bridges the gap between massive-scale cloud infrastructure and intelligent automation. I build tools that not only deploy software but actively monitor, heal, and explain system states using Generative AI.

* **Core Focus:** Cloud-Native AI Tools, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and Autonomous Agents.
* **Target Architecture:** Local-First Enterprise Workspaces, Self-Healing Infrastructure, and RAG Pipelines.
